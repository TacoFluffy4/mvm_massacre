# mvm_massacre
A map to help get the Metal Massacre and T-1000000 achievements in TF2.

# How to install
Download the [release zip](https://github.com/TacoFluffy4/mvm_massacre/releases/tag/v1.2) file from the right side of the github page. 

You want to download and extract the map_files.zip folder.

You will then want to copy the `tf` folder that you extracted into the tf2 instilation directory (default locaiton is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2`). There should already be a folder named tf there, and dragging this over should merge the two folders.

This should have put a file in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\maps` called `mvm_massacre.bsp` and `mvm_massacre.nav` aswell as two .pop files in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\maps` folder.

# How to use
1. Launch tf2.
1. In the console type `map mvm_massacre` to join the map.
1. In the console type `tf_mvm_min_players_to_start 1`
1. You may have to call a vote to change the mission depending on which achievement you are going for.
1. Don't go into the red area, stay on the grey and shoot towards the red, the robots should not be able to hurt you.
1. Kill the robots, pyro or engie is recommended.
1. Use `+attack` so you can idle.

The Metal Massacre achievement will still take a while as the requirement for it is absurd.

The Normal mission is for Metal Massacre and T1 is for T-1000000.
